# ESG-AI-Assistant

We developed this ESG AI assistant to simplify and optimize the ESG compliance assessment and policy-making process. This is our project demo.
When a user submits an ESG report file in any format, the system will extract a formatted JSON file from it, retrieve relevant regulations from the regulatory text database for analysis, and give evaluation opinions through a fine-tuned large language model. It also has the function of locating the original text and giving modification opinions. Users can also obtain further analysis opinions through multiple rounds of dialogue with the model.
